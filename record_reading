生命是一条贯通的河流，一切皆是没有开始的复始，我们所期望的终点并不存在。
————《结，起点亦是终点》
大多数人在他们学会游泳前从来不游泳。
听起来怪怪的是吧？他们不会游自然不游！我们天生就在这个固态的土地上生存，而不是水里。
他们自然也没有去思考。他们是为活着而生的，而不是为思考。
'Most men will not swim before they are able to.' 
Is not that witty? Naturally, they won't swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. 
And naturally they won't think. They are made for life, not for thought. 
Yes, and he who thinks, what's more, he who makes thought his business,
he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.
